/** @file
  Base Timer Library implementation which uses the Time Stamp Counter in the processor.

  For AMD processors the time-stamp counter increments at a constant rate.
  That rate may be set by the maximum core-clock to bus-clock ratio of the processor or may be set by
  the maximum resolved frequency at which the processor is booted. The maximum resolved frequency may
  differ from the maximum qualified frequency of the processor.

  The specific processor configuration determines the behavior. Constant TSC behavior ensures that the
  duration of each clock tick is uniform and supports the use of the TSC as a wall clock timer even if
  the processor core changes frequency. This is the architectural behavior moving forward.

  A Processor's support for invariant TSC is indicated by CPUID.0x80000007.EDX[8].
